Over time, I've built or helped build a number of companies. Here's a listing of the companies that are most important to me and my history.

## [FounderBlocks](https://founderblocks.io/)

Starting out as VIPERdev, FounderBlocks is to date active and helps getting about 2-5 founders live _per month_ with their product.

## Renewables Now

Renewables Now is operating a marketplace for solar projects and investments.

## BuyingMachine

With BuyingMachine, we help companies to build better B2B sales funnels.

## Hofly

With Hofly, we created a marketplace that allows farmers to sell directly to consumers and restaurants.

The majority of the business was sold in August 2024.

## GitMate

GitMate was my first real startup, a spinoff of our [coala](https://coala.io/) open source project. Although we learned a lot, GitHub and GitLab at some point started building similar features as part of their platforms and it made more sense to discontinue the company to venture out with others rather than investing several more years even though budget was still available.

For me, GitMate meant a lot of learning and I consider it my "first obligatory startup that fails" that every founder ought to have :).
