Running and sports is part of my life since several years and helps me to turn my mind off from all the coding and company building.

While I primarily run, I also love engaging in triathlons or trying new sports I don't know.

## Train With Me

I hate training alone. I'm serious. Without a running partner, most of the time I won't go outside.

_No matter the pace_, I love running with other people, even if it's "just" a quick 3k round at 6min/km or a gym workout.

If you know me and want to run with me, simply contact me and we'll find a way, either in person or via [same.run](https://same.run/) remotely.

## Give Me Numbers

Below you'll find my personal bests.

Why do I share them? I'm kinda proud. Should you care? Probably not ;).
